The Social Media Content Analyzer is a web-based tool designed to extract and analyze content from uploaded PDF or image files to suggest engagement improvements. The system supports drag-and-drop uploads for PDFs and images. It uses PDF parsing (via PyPDF2/pdfplumber) for text-based documents and OCR (pytesseract) for image-based text extraction. Once extracted, the text is processed through an AI language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT) that evaluates tone, readability, and keyword richness. The model then suggests improved captions, hashtags, and optimized phrasing to increase engagement. The frontend is built using React and Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive interface, while the backend leverages FastAPI for API handling. The app includes loading indicators, validation checks, and clear documentation, ensuring a smooth and professional user experience.
